GROUP BY MONTH(created_at);

2. SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD('2022-01-01', INTERVAL seq.seq MONTH), '%M') AS name,
    IFNULL(COUNT(properties.created_at), 0) AS amt
FROM

    properties ON MONTH(properties.created_at) = MONTH(DATE_ADD('2022-01-01', INTERVAL seq.seq MONTH)) 
               AND YEAR(properties.created_at) = YEAR(CURDATE())
GROUP BY 
    seq.seq;
